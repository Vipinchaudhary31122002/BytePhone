# 📱 BytePhone 2025: Mobile Price Prediction

A data science project that explores, visualizes, and models smartphone features from a futuristic 2025 dataset to predict mobile prices using machine learning.

## 📊 Project Overview

This notebook focuses on a comprehensive workflow involving:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training using `RandomForestRegressor`
- Evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics

The goal is to understand which features most influence mobile pricing and build a predictive model for estimating smartphone prices.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is named **"Mobiles Dataset (2025)"**, which includes the following features:
- RAM (GB)
- Storage (GB)
- Battery Capacity
- Display Size
- Camera Specs (Front & Back)
- Mobile Weight
- Price (Target variable)
